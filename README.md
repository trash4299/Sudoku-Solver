# Sudoku-Solvers
Java program for solving a sudoku puzzle


I am just messing around with tables right now and I am trying to see how I should display them and use them. So that is what the 2d testin class is.

I want to iron out this before I start fully doing the methods that solve it. This is just going to be a brute force and will probably not be as efficient as other ones.
