# Sudoku-Solver
Java program for solving a sudoku puzzle

My Solver is just going to be a brute force and will not be as efficient as other ones. I am simulating the human processes of solving a Sudoku puzzle specifically focusing on preemptive sets and the Occupancy Theorem. I am going through and adding new methods of filling in numbers. 

I want to add more advanced ways of solving puzzles like the "X-Wing" method, but that will take time. I also want to add timers so I can compare this to my non-recursive solver.
