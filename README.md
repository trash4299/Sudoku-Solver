# Sudoku-Solver
Java program for solving a sudoku puzzle

My Solver is just going to be a brute force and will not be as efficient as other ones. I am simulating the human processes of solving a Sudoku puzzle specifically focusing on preemptive sets and the Occupancy Theorem. I am going through and adding new methods of filling in numbers.

It is not working right now and I am going through and fixing the bugs.
